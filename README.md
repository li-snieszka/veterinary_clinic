# Veterinary Clinic Application

## Database

In the main root of application there is folder <a href="veterinary_clinic/database-configuration">database-configuration</a>. 
This folder contains:
- <a href="veterinary_clinic/database-configuration/database-screenshot.png">screenshot</a> of database model 
- .m2 file extension which include editable model. Use TOAD data modeler for that. 
- script for creating whole database with relations. There is also part responsible for inserting data into tables which might be removed as needed. 

To the proper working of app you have to setup config file app_local.php. 
If you want to run app local with xampp basic settings for that file are: 
- 'host' => 'localhost',
- 'username' => 'root',
- 'password' => '',
- 'database' => 'veterinary_clinic',

[![PHPStan](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHPStan-level%207-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)

A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 4.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app [app_name]`.

If Composer is installed globally, run

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app
```

In case you want to use a custom app dir name (e.g. `/myapp/`):

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app myapp
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and setup the 
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) (v1.3) minimalist CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
